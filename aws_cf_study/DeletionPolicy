In cloud formation after the deleting the stack all the provesion which are created by cloudformation will be deleted.
To retain the the provision even after the stack deletion, use the following code in the resources set of the stack

"DeletionPolicy" : "Retain"

Example:

{
  "AWSTemplateFormatVersion" : "2010-09-09",
  "Resources" : {
    "myS3Bucket" : {
      "Type" : "AWS::S3::Bucket",
      "DeletionPolicy" : "Retain"
    }
  }
}

## We Also have a snapshot policy which takes the snapshot of some reources while deletion
## Snapshot is supported only for the following resources

AWS::EC2::Volume, 
AWS::ElastiCache::CacheCluster,
AWS::ElastiCache::ReplicationGroup,
AWS::RDS::DBInstance, 
AWS::RDS::DBCluster, 
AWS::Redshift::Cluster
